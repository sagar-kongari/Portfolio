# 🗺️: Sagar's Portfolio Guide
Greetings!🙏 Here's a gist of my Data Portfolio.

## Python
| Project | Area of Focus | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **[👦Real-time Face Tracker](https://github.com/skadoozy/Object-Detection-Model/blob/main/README.md)** | Deep Learning | Built a real-time face tracking model using open-cv and tensorflow |
| [**🚗 Toyota Stock Price Prediction**](https://github.com/skadoozy/Time-Series-Forecasting/blob/main/README.md) | Time Series | Stock price analysis & prediction of Toyota motors using SARIMA model |
| [**📰 Auto Sentiments Scraper**](https://github.com/skadoozy/News-Scrape-Summarize-Sentiment/blob/main/README.md) | Natural Language Processing | Automating scraping of financial news from the web, summarizing parsed texts, performing sentiment analysis and exporting results as a CSV file. |
| [**👗 Style Recommender System**](https://github.com/skadoozy/Style-Recommender-System/blob/main/README.md) | Recommender system | Image Recommender System using RESNET50 and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. |
| [**🌻Cifar10 Classification**](https://github.com/skadoozy/Cifar10-ANN-CNN/blob/main/README.md) | Deep Learning | Image classification using Artificial neural network and Convolutional neural network. Which one performs better? |
